This project is a POC for Java 8 Collections

Data is extracted from data.csv file and specific operations are made to get the required output :

1. Employees who have worked for 7 consecutive days
2. Employees who have less than 10hrs but greater than 1hr between shifts
3. Employees who have worked for more than 14hrs in a shift


The results are as follows : 

Employees who have worked for 7 consecutive days :
